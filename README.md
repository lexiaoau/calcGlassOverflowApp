calculate liquid overflow problem using python 3

There is a stack of water glasses in a form of triangle as illustrated. Each glass
has a 250ml capacity. When a liquid is poured into the top most glass any
overflow is evenly distributed between the glasses in the next row.

That is, half of the overflow pours into the left glass while the remainder of the
overflow pours into the right glass.

Write a program that is able to calculate and illustrate how much liquid
is in the j’th glass of the i’th row when K litres are poured into the top
most glass.
